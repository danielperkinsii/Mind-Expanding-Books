## Adding new book
* The book I am adding is The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle
* I am adding this book to FICTION section.
* I have read this book 1 time.
* I think this book deserves to be in this list because this book could be the epitome of mind-expanding. It has layers of themes with a main character that traverses reality and an unknown, parallel world. It's surreal. It's thought provoking and makes you feel the edges of your feelings. The book also has some refreshing comedic relief. And this book will hopefully provide a little diversity since it's written by a Japanese Author! :-)
